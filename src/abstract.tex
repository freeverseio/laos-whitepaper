\begin{abstract}

This whitepaper presents the vision and design of LAOS,
the Living Assets Open System,
a truly non-custodial dynamic NFT protocol
that, leveraging its core feature of bridgeless minting and evolution,
aims to establish itself as the go-to platform
for creating and evolving digital goods across all blockchains.
% 
With an architecture planned for sharding-based scalability patterns,
LAOS will enable applications that unlock the full power of 
digital ownership, migrating from the current mindset of scarcity and speculation, 
to one of abundance and captured User Generated Value.
% 
LAOS addresses the growing issue of custodianship,
where companies hold users' NFT essential data
to achieve asset mutability, thus assuming risks typically associated with securities,
by providing a genuinely decentralized legislation-compliant solution.
