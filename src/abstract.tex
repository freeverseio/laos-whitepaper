\begin{abstract}

This whitepaper presents the vision and design for LAOS,
a truly non-custodial dynamic NFT protocol
that, leveraging its core features of bridgeless connectivity to all EVM chains,
as well as second-order type of scalability,
aims to establish itself as the consensus system that every other
chain uses to scale their Digital Ownership transactions,
instantly and securely, and without bridging.
% 
With an architecture planned for sharding-based scalability patterns,
LAOS will enable currently mature ecosystems, such as Ethereum, to support applications
that unlock the full power of digital ownership,
migrating from the current mindset of scarcity and speculation, 
to one of abundance and captured User Generated Value.
% 
LAOS addresses the growing issue of custodianship,
where companies hold users' NFT essential data
to achieve asset mutability, thus assuming risks typically associated with securities,
by providing a genuinely decentralized legislation-compliant solution.
