\section{Conclusions} \label{conclusion}

We have presented the vision and design for a truly non-custodial
dynamic NFT protocol, ready to scale any existing chain that 
supports smart contracts,
and enable fairer, main-stream,
models around digital ownership, 
such as User Generated Value patterns.

The platform fully embraces the Polkadot ethos of
excelling in a specific domain while achieving
exceptional performance and scalability.
It leverages the rich feature set
offered by other Parachains within the ecosystem,
benefiting from the inherent trustless interoperability
provided by Polkadot.

LAOS provides the foundations for a fully legislation compliant 
way of creating and managing NFTs, that directly tackles the {\it elephant
in the room} issue, the pattern whereby many companies become the custodian
of the attributes of the NFTs of their users in order to enable asset mutability, or save 
gas costs. LAOS will actively foster community engagement
to raise awareness about existing practices and advocate
for migrations towards non-custodial alternatives.
It will encourage and support initiatives that promote
the adoption of decentralized solutions,
empowering users to maintain control over their assets.

With the key feature of bridgeless minting and evolution at its core,
LAOS aims at becoming the home of Digital Ownership and Dynamic NFTs, the platform
where digital goods are created and evolved for all blockchains.
