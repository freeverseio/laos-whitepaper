\section{Living Assets and LAOS}\label{living-assets}

Living Assets (LA) are Non-Fungible Tokens implemented in LAOS. 
LA extend the technology of the first wave of NFT by adding the
following features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scalability. LA can evolve at scale, in fully decentralized flows;
    \item Full Decentralization. The attributes of all LA, now, and in every past state, can be certified on-chain, without 
    resorting to centralized privately-owned servers (technical details in Section \ref{sec:architecture});
    \item Bridgeless Minting \& Evolution. LA can be traded in any blockchain that supports smart contracts,
    while being minted and evolved in LAOS, without the need to resort to any type of bridge
    (technical details in Section \ref{sec:bridgeless-tech}).
\end{itemize}

The following subsections provide a high-level overview of how these 
properties can be leveraged, focusing on the developers and users
point of view. The low-level technical
aspects are left for sections \ref{sec:architecture} and  \ref{sec:bridgeless-tech}.

\subsection{User Generated Value}\label{sec:ugv}

Scalability and the trust generated by the fact that 
mutability has a fully verifiable history are the key ingredients 
to one of the main paradigm shifts that Living Assets enable.

LA enable digital industries to migrate from a mindset of {\it scarcity} and {\it speculation},
to one of {\it abundance} and {\it User Generated Value} (UGV). In the latter, 
assets can be distributed at scale, at zero or very small initial value
(e.g., just for downloading and application or for signing-in), to a large base of users, hence 
eliminating all monetary entry barriers to owning a digital asset.

In this mindset of abundance, the initial market value of most assets is effectively zero.
DApps using LA can provide the flexibility to evolve based on both
off-chain activity (such as real-world events) and on-chain data.
By engaging with apps, video games,
online and social media activity, and the broader ecosystem,
LA owners can improve their assets (a more powerful game item,
an NFT that grants better rewards, an IP license granting further rights),
making them more valuable to others,
eventually converting their dedication, talent, and effort,
into increased market value.

        co-exist alongside a smaller percentage that have accrued significant value
        through the efforts of their owners.

\end{Figure}

UGV paradigms tend to reflect patterns common to Free-to-Play models
(Figure \ref{fig:pyramid}), whereby
a large base of assets with near-zero market value co-exist with further layers
of assets which users have evolved significantly with their actions. This pattern turns the 
sentiment of owning digital assets into an {\it active} experience, 
becoming a powerful engagement tool.


\subsection{Certifiability}\label{sec:ugv-certifiable}

UGV and the use cases mentioned in sections \ref{sec:la-bridglessness}-\ref{sec:use cases}
heavily rely on the history of the asset, on the confidence that NFTs have
market value accrued through a fair, traceable, set of evolutions.
It becomes paramount to be able to answer, in a fully trustless way, 
questions like {\it how did users turn this game item into something so powerful?}, or {\it how did
the owners of this NFT evolve it from scratch to an item with level-10 rewards?}

This is manifestly impossible in centralized flows derived from 
pattern \bref{eq:tokenURICentral}, since external privately-owned servers need 
to be trusted, exactly as in the pre-blockchain era.

LAOS provides the strongest forms of certifiability. On the one hand,
as described in Section \ref{sec:architecture}, all {\it data is fully available}
via decentralized flows, including data about the current and
past attributes of every asset.

On the other hand, LAOS enables any party to prove on-chain that an asset
with tokenId $id$ was in a certain state $s$ at any time $t$ in its history,
via the provision
of inclusion proofs $\Pi(id, s,t)$; these allow the blockchain to build {\it verify} 
methods which return true/false when queried:
\bea
\mbox{verify: \espai} id, s, t, \Pi(id, s,t) & \rightarrow & \mbox{bool}\,.
\eea

By virtue of LAOS being in the Polkadot ecosystem, it will be possible
to use these strong forms of certifiability as part of smart contract logic
built in other Parachains, such as Moonbeam\cite{moonbeam} or Astar\cite{astar}.
Example use cases would be contracts that allow owners of 
NFTs that have been evolved beyond a certain level to unlock certain rewards,
or that execute methods of a DeFi contract in the same blockchain.
An illustrative example of pseudo-code would be:
\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \KwData{Input values $id, s, t, \Pi(id, s,t)$}
    do initial logic\;
    \If{\textnormal{verify($id, s, t, \Pi$($id, s,t$))}}{
        do further logic based on $s,t$\;
    }
\end{algorithm}

Perhaps the simplest, yet powerful, example of this usage would be to enable {\it certified purchases}.
In this pattern, a buyer could sign a purchase transaction that is conditional on the asset
attributes, e.g., "buy this asset if and only if it has {\it level} larger than 100".

\subsection{Bridgeless Minting \& Evolution}\label{sec:la-bridglessness}

The scalable, strongly-certifiable, minting and evolution features of LAOS
can be added on top of the advantages that leading blockchains already
have in terms of mature ecosystems of users and DApps.

By means of example, we hereby discuss the use case of developers that
want to build applications which benefit both from LAOS features and
Ethereum's rich ecosystem of smart contracts and DApps.
Any other blockchain that supports Turing-complete
programming of smart contracts would work too. 

Developers only need to deploy once
an ERC721/1155 smart contract in Ethereum,
tuned to use the Universal Location pattern as described
in section \ref{sec:bridgeless-tech}. Next, they can mint and evolve
assets in that contract by simply executing the corresponding transactions in the 
LAOS blockchain. Anyone can permissionlessly, in a fully decentralized manner,
and without resorting to bridges, build new, or connect to existing,
marketplaces that operate with these assets by means of standard
ERC721/1155 calls on Ethereum.
In particular, this contract's assets can be connected, e.g., to smart contracts
in Ethereum that allow their rental or to fractionalize their ownership.

By doing so, applications can leverage paradigms where massive amounts
of assets are created in a scalable, certifiable way, in LAOS, with only
a small fraction of them having fairly accrued enough User Generated Value 
to be worth tradeable in Ethereum.


\subsection{Use cases}\label{sec:use cases}

Living Assets profoundly change traditional paradigms,
heralding new prospects for creators, users, and industries at large.
By actively engaging with LA, owners wield the power
to shape and influence the attributes of their assets,
thereby directly impacting their intrinsic value.
This interactive participation fosters deeper connections between
users and their assets, transcending the conventional
notion of passive ownership.

The reimagining of digital ownership opens up
a wide range of compelling use cases.
With developers and their communities empowered by
new tools and increased flexibility,
it is impossible to predict the full extent of their
creative potential. Nevertheless, here are a few examples
that can be envisaged today.

{\bf Brand Loyalty Program.}
Consider the prospect of owning a 
cool new shoe from one of the world's most admired shoe manufacturers
that undergoes progressive "leveling up" in
design and quality as a direct consequence of brand mentions,
retweets, and shares achieved by the owner on social media platforms.
This interactive paradigm unlocks escalating discounts and privileges, forging deeper bonds of loyalty and engagement with the brand.

{\bf Entertainment.}
In the realm of entertainment,
LA enable the possession
of hyperreal Avatars representing beloved celebrities.
These Avatars evolve dynamically in response
to user interactions within their ecosystem,
encompassing activities such as quizzes,
merchandise engagement, and attendance at real-world events.
As users ascend to higher levels through sustained participation,
exclusive privileges like meet-and-greet opportunities unlock.

{\bf Gaming.}
LA empowers the gaming landscape by
endowing players with the ability to nurture the evolutionary journey
of their weapons, such as an "axe,"
from rudimentary stages to lofty tiers of rarity,
namely epic and legendary.
This progression is intrinsically linked to the player's skill,
dedication, and accomplishments within the game,
creating a gratifying sense of {\it fairness}, achievement and recognition.

{\bf Intellectual Property (IP) Rights.}
LA introduce innovative possibilities for the
dynamic evolution of IP licenses
associated with digital artwork.
At the outset, the license may impose stringent restrictions,
confining the permissible print size to dimensions no larger than A4.
However, as users proactively promote the artist and acquire
additional pieces from the artist's collection,
the license undergoes an evolutionary transformation.
Ultimately, it may grant permission for the artwork to be exhibited for-profit,
including the prerogative to levy an entrance fee.
This seamless evolution is intricately encoded within the asset's
attributes, ensuring transparency, integrity, and equitable governance.

{\bf User Generated Content.}
LA allows the flourishing community of content generators to 
accrue market value to their talent and dedication. In an in-game example,
users can customize their in-game racing car,
from engine tweaks, to paint job and looks,
making it drive faster and look awesome,
and be more desirable for every other player.
